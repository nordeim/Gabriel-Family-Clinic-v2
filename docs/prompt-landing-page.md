attached is the high-level mission and vision of the website. from my understanding, the codebase component files had been more or less created, but though tested individually, the landing page when the codebase is built (`npm run build`) and run (`npm run start`) looks some bare minimum skeleton, totally off from the actual UI/UX design and aesthetic envisioned and expected from the lofty declaration of the high-level design objectives. You task now is to first deeply envision what the main landing page should look like in the first place based on your deep thinking and re-imagination of the `project_high-level-vision.md`, then create a static HTML mockup of what you as the best UI/UX and aesthetic designer in the world would be very proud to show off to the world your superb functional, visual and usability design skills. The final objective is to update the codebase so that the active website will look like your mockup. You will

1) Finish the meticulous planning (including JS and validation).
2) Provide a full, high-quality implementation:
   - `static/index.html`
   - `static/styles/globals.css`
   - `static/js/landing.js`

Constraints and intentions restated:

- Static HTML mockup only.
- Tech:
  - Google Fonts.
  - Shadcn-UI-inspired components (no runtime dependency, just in styling).
  - Reuse concepts from `src/styles/globals.css`.
  - Separate JS file (performance, adaptability).
 
This is a very important task and mission to build a presentable and usable web platform that I will be proud off. So use the Meticulous Approach to meticulously plan carefully and systematically before proceed with the execution. Create plan and sub-plans (if necessary) and save/stage them under the `docs/` folder before your execute the plan/sub-plan step by step meticulously and cautiously.
