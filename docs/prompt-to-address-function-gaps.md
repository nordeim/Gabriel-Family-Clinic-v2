awesome review and analysis! please meticulously review the relevant current code files to validate your understanding of the current implementation gaps. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to address the features/functions implementation gaps in logical phases that can be executed independently, start with the most needed/important functionality/feaure. include in your implementation plan, a list of files to update or add in each phase, and for each file, include a description of the changes to make and a checklist for each file. After meticulous review of the relevant existing code files and the creation of the implementation to close the feature/functionality gaps in phases, review and validate the finalized implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute according to the plan.
