you have done an amazingly awesome job so far! Based on your awesome `Project_Architecture_Document.md` and `Master_Execution_Plan.md`, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to create the complete and detailed `database_schema.sql` with an accompanying deployment scripts, `deploy_database.py` and `run_database_deploy.sh`, to create the database user and initialize the database followed by deploying the complete database schema. create a sample `.env` for executing the python script. Then meticulously create the implementation plan, review and validate the plan before executing.
